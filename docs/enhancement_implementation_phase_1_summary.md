  1. Dependencies & Infrastructure
    - Added ag2[gemini]>=0.9.9 to pyproject.toml
    - Created cra_rules.csv with Canadian tax compliance rules
    - Implemented CRABusinessRulesService for CSV rule management
  2. Multi-Agent System
    - BaseReceiptAgent: Abstract base class for all agents
    - DataExtractionAgent: Uses autogen + Gemini for receipt data parsing
    - CRArulesAgent: Applies Canadian tax law and business categorization
    - TaxCalculatorAgent: Validates GST/HST and calculates deductible amounts
    - AgentOrchestrator: Coordinates the 3-agent workflow with consensus
  3. API Integration
    - New endpoint: POST /api/v1/receipts/extract-with-agents
    - Response includes agent confidence scores and CRA rule references
    - Full backward compatibility with existing endpoints

  🔑 Key Features

  1. Transparency & CRA Compliance
    - Each agent provides confidence scores
    - CRA rules visible with ITA section references
    - Audit risk assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
    - T2125 line numbers for tax filing
  2. Consensus & Validation
    - Simple averaging consensus method
    - Flags for manual review when confidence < 75%
    - Partial results if one agent fails
    - 2-second timeout per agent
  3. Backward Compatibility
    - Existing /api/v1/receipts/extract endpoint unchanged
    - JSON business rules remain functional
    - CLI and web UI continue to work as before

  📝 Usage Example

  # Test the new multi-agent endpoint
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/receipts/extract-with-agents \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "image_base64": "<base64_encoded_receipt>",
      "additional_context": "Business lunch at Marriott hotel"
    }'

  🚀 Next Steps

  The only remaining item is the accounting dashboard UI (Phase 1C), which would display:
  - Ledger-style expense table
  - Summary cards (total expenses, deductible amounts, review items)
  - CSV export functionality
  - Confidence score color coding

  The multi-agent system is fully functional and ready for testing!
