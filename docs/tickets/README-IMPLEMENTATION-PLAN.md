# Multi-Category Expense Processing Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation plan for transforming QuickExpense into a scalable, multi-category expense processing system that handles complex receipts like Marriott hotel bills with proper tax categorization and QuickBooks integration.

## Problem Statement
Current system only handles single-category expenses, making it impossible to properly process complex receipts like hotel bills that contain:
- Room charges (100% deductible)
- Restaurant charges (50% deductible per CRA rules)
- Tourism levies (100% deductible)
- GST/HST (100% Input Tax Credit eligible)

## Solution Architecture
**Scalable, configuration-driven system** that handles any expense type through:
- **Enhanced models** supporting multi-category line items
- **Business rules engine** for configurable categorization logic
- **Universal file processing** for PDF and image receipts
- **Context-aware AI** extraction with business intelligence
- **Multi-line QuickBooks integration** with proper account mapping

## Verification: Marriott Hotel Bill Processing
âœ… **Input:** PDF hotel bill with mixed accommodation/meals
âœ… **Processing:** Rules engine categorizes each line item appropriately
âœ… **Output:** 3 separate QuickBooks entries with correct tax treatment
âœ… **Compliance:** Full CRA compliance with proper deductibility calculations
