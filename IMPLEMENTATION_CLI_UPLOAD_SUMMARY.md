# QuickExpense CLI Implementation Summary

## üéØ Objective Achieved

Successfully implemented a complete CLI entry point for QuickExpense that allows users to upload single receipt images and automatically create expenses in QuickBooks Online.

## üõ†Ô∏è What We Built

### 1. **Complete CLI Interface** (`src/quickexpense/cli.py`)
- `quickexpense upload <receipt>` - Main command to process receipts
- `quickexpense auth` - OAuth authentication with QuickBooks
- `quickexpense status` - System health and connection check
- `--dry-run` option for testing without creating expenses
- `--output json` for programmatic integration

### 2. **Fixed Critical QuickBooks Integration Issues**
- **Problem**: "Invalid account type used" error when creating expenses
- **Root Cause**: Missing `AccountRef` field in Purchase API calls
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `get_bank_accounts()` and `get_credit_card_accounts()` methods
  - Implemented smart payment account selection (banks preferred)
  - Fixed Purchase data structure with all required fields

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Automatic token refresh with retry logic
- Helpful status command showing connection state
- User-friendly authentication flow

## üìã Testing Performed

### Successful End-to-End Test
```bash
$ uv run quickexpense upload /Users/manonjacquin/Documents/receipts/Harrods.jpg

Extracting data from receipt: Harrods.jpg

=== Result ===

```

## üêõ Issues Fixed

1. **Field Mapping Error**: Changed `transaction_date` to `date` in receipt model
2. **OAuth Manager Integration**: Fixed parameter passing and token refresh
3. **Purchase API Structure**: Added required `AccountRef` field
4. **Token Expiration**: Added clear error messages and re-auth guidance
5. **Purchase ID Display**: Fixed to show correct ID from API response
